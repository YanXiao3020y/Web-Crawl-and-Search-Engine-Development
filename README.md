**Overview**

This project involves implementing a web crawler and a search engine for
the ics.uci.edu domain using Python. It starts by crawling the domain
and collecting various data points, such as unique pages and common
words, and then building an inverted index for those pages. The project
progresses through milestones, beginning with the creation of a basic
retrieval component and eventually developing a full-fledged search
engine capable of handling simple queries and ranking results using
methods like TF-IDF.
